Module 10, Mission to Mars - Web Scraping with HTML/CSS


This module introduced HTML, Mongo DB, as well as the concept of scraping information off of different websites. The "drilling-down" in HTML on different websites was tricky to begin with but was more intuitive the more I did it. We scraped the most recent news article title and a snippit of the article from the website "redplanetscience.com". We scraped the featured image of the day from the website "spaceimages-mars.com". We scraped the table of mars facts off of the website "galaxyfacts-mars.com". We finally scraped the 4 images of the martian hemispheres and their titles off of the website "marshemispheres.com". This challange and module was QUITE difficult. Learning to read a HTML page, setting up Mongo, then setting up an index.html page of our own, AND making sure they all play together nicely was EXTREMELY difficult.
